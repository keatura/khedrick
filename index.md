# Introduction

Hello! I am Keaton Hedrick. I am a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, and I am in my Senior year and final semester.

# Portfolio Works

##  **Unity Zelda Dungeon** - By Keaton: 

https://kateura.itch.io/zelda-dungeon-snippet
> Using Unity and C#, I developed the majority of the weapons and Enemy AIs. I also created a duplication mechanic in which Link can create weaker copies of himself. I experimented with audio in creating the sound effect for the switches, alongside art in creating all of the custom sprites.

## **Transpose** - By Keaton: 

https://kateura.itch.io/transpose
> This game was a rapid prototype project. I wanted to develop some sort of game with a teleport mechanic, so I did that. This game is about fast momentum-based platforming and navigation when using teleportation.

## **Slam Jam** - By Keaton, Jay, Owen, Charles, and Justin:

https://jvijan.itch.io/slam-jam
> This was my EECS494 final project, a music-themed precision/puzzle platformer where you play as a clown horn with the ability to make the ground quake with your SLAM ability! Interact with instruments and follow the golden notes to join the greatest circus in the world!
>
> As part of Studio One working on this project, I was the sole artist and publicist, as well as being the main team coordinator and main developer for the groundwork systems of the game.
> As a developer, I was responsible for the 2D-platformer character controller, slam mechanic, the creation of the tremor and tilemap systems, the reaction-based amp blocks, and the refinement of all key features of the game.
> This game was programmed using Unity and C#, and team management was accomplished via Jira and Discord.
