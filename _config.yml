  Unity Zelda Dungeon - By Keaton: 
  https://kateura.itch.io/zelda-dungeon-snippet
  Using Unity and C#, I developed the majority of the weapons and Enemy AIs. I also created a duplication mechanic in which Link can create weaker copies of himself. I experimented with audio in creating the sound effect for the switches, alongside art in creating all of the custom sprites.
  --- Transpose - By Keaton:

  This game was a rapid prototype project. I wanted to develop some sort of game with a teleport mechanic, so I did that. This game is about fast momentum-based platforming and navigation when using teleportation."
