##  **Unity Zelda Dungeon** - By Keaton: 
https://kateura.itch.io/zelda-dungeon-snippet
Using Unity and C#, I developed the majority of the weapons and Enemy AIs. I also created a duplication mechanic in which Link can create weaker copies of himself. I experimented with audio in creating the sound effect for the switches, alongside art in creating all of the custom sprites.
